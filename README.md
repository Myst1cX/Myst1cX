# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m a developer by necessity, not by profession.

I don’t code 9-to-5. I just build things when I get too lazy to do them manually. That usually means browser extensions, small tools, or little scripts that automate away the repetitive, the annoying, and the just-plain-boring.

Think of me as an efficiency addict with a keyboard. If I do something more than twice, odds are I’m already thinking about how to script it.

This isn’t a portfolio. It’s more like a digital junk drawer of automation experiments and “wouldn’t-it-be-nice-if” ideas that actually made it past procrastination.

If you found something useful here, cool. If not, well — it was probably just for me anyway
