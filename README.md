## ðŸ”­ ABOUT ME:
>I wouldnâ€™t call myself a developer in the traditional sense. I just like solving little annoyances with automation, even if it means cobbling something together using the magic of the internet, some clever tools, and a lot of trial and error.

>Most of the time, I build out of necessity: browser extensions, small tools, or little scripts that automate away the repetitive, the annoying, and the just-plain-boring.

>This isnâ€™t a portfolio. Itâ€™s a collection of semi-functional shortcuts, experiments, and digital duct tape thatâ€™s worked well enough to share.

>If it helps you too, awesome. If not â€” it probably wasnâ€™t meant for you anyway.
